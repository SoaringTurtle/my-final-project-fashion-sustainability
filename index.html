          <p class="fadein">The fashion industry began in the early 19th century, and while clothing has existed for significantly longer, the industry today impacts almost everyone. Simple decisions such as deciding which fast fashion outlet clearance section to sift through are juxtaposed to low garment worker wages and the virtually impossible to precisely calculate impact on the planet. These facets of the industry are points of discussion when talking about the industry today, however, one aspect that does not get as much attention are the brand owners of smaller fashion companies.
          </p>
          
          <p class="fadein">People usually don’t know where their clothes are made, let alone who made them, or who designed them. The difference in resources and finances impacts every line of the chain when comparing larger brands and fashion houses to those run by one, or a handful. 
          </p>

          <p class="fadein"> 2020 and the Covid-19 pandemic brought industries to their knees as supply chains slowed down, manufacturers had to adapt to social distancing guidelines, and the manner in which we here in the United States consume clothing would see a heavy shift at least for the next year. Spotlight has been cast on the financial losses, struggles of larger companies, the commodification of “pandemic” themed apparel, but little has been said about small business owners and how they’ve managed to stay afloat during this tumultuous time.
          </p>
          
          
          <p class="fadein">For my project I interviewed multiple small brands owners and content creators to get an inside scoop on their day to day, struggles of the pandemic, their hopes for the future, and ultimately how to be in their shoes. Click a picture below for more:
