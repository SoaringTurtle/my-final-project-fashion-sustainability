          <p class="fadein"> The rise of social media has also lead to many creating their own brands from their experiences in hopes of reaching a new audience. The emergence of a spectrum rather than set standards surrounding expression in regards to fashion with an accompanying increase in availability, variety, and influences, fashion as a part of society has transformed into something much more. Social media as a conduit to share our individual expression has propagated fashion as something to be experienced with others.

          <p class="fadein">In February of 2010, HBO released How To Make It In America, a show following young adults Ben Epstein and Cam  Calderon as they attempt to start a denim brand in the lively New York City fashion scene and in turn the “American Dream.” The quote above highlights a scene from the season 1 finale in which mutual friend of Ben and Cam, Domingo. While sitting in a park, Domingo begins to recount the story of his uncle Julius.  At this point in the show, both Ben and Cam have experienced setback, after setback on their path to success and after a delivery truck full of their product is stolen, the duo are worried for their future in the industry.

          <p class="fadein">“Things come and go. Money comes and goes, t-shirts come and go. Sometimes there’s greater forces at work than we’re aware of. You know what I mean? You just gotta roll with those ****** punches, you know?” - Domingo Brown, <i>How To Make It In America</i>
          </p>
          
          <p class="fadein"> When all seems lost, Domingo’s exclamation that, “You just gotta roll with those fucking punches,” encapsulates the central message of the show. The road to achieving the American Dream is neither easy, nor does it come without adversity, but having the ability to persevere through it all has the ability to turn dreams into reality. The struggles highlighted in How To Make It In America correlate more than a decade later as a new generation of designers rises to the challenge.

          <p class="fadein"> 2020 and the Covid-19 pandemic brought industries to their knees as supply chains slowed down, manufacturers had to adapt to social distancing guidelines, and the manner in which we here in the United States consume clothing would see a heavy shift at least for the next year. Spotlight has been cast on the financial losses, struggles of larger companies, the commodification of “pandemic” themed apparel, but little has been said about small business owners in the fashion industry and how they’ve managed to stay afloat during this tumultuous time. Similar to the plights of Ben and Cam, creators of today face both the well known challenges of building up a business, but doing so under an ever evolving pandemic created an entirely new set of problems for hopeful creatives aiming to get their foot in the door.
          </p>
          
          <p class="fadein">For my project I interviewed multiple small brands owners and content creators to get an inside scoop on their day to day, struggles of the pandemic, their hopes for the future, and ultimately how to be in their shoes. Over a year from the start of the pandemic, these three creatives are pushing themselves everyday in hopes of making a larger impact on their communities and the industry itself.</p>
