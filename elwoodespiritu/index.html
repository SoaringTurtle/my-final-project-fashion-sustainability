          <p class="fadein"> Elwood Espiritu is brand owner and designer for Slow Jamz, a brand inspired by hip-hop and R and B from the 90s. The primary page for the brand functions as a moodboard for Elwood to share current music tastes, insights into older songs and artists, or simply content meant to trigger nostalgia.
          </p>
          
          <p class="fadein"> Along with operating Slow Jamz, Elwood also runs Color Archive, a brand focused on sportwear from the early 2000's and a new creative venture, Studio Espiritu, where Elwood creats custom tufted rugs.
          </p>
          
          
          <p class="fadein"> As a result of the pandemic, Elwood had to source new manufacturing for his existing clothing brands and took the oppertunity to explore a new skill through Studio Espiritu as a result of stay at home orders. A year on from the intial onset of the pandemic some things have gone back to normal, while other changes and adaptations are made both for Elwood, but also other still grappling with industry changes. To learn more about a shift in drop culture, the importance of failure, and a sneak peek at the early stages of what a Slow Jamz event could look like post pandemic continue reading for our interview below:

          <p class="fadein"><b>Could you tell me a bit about your background and what it is that you do?
          </b>
          </p>
          
          <p class="fadein"> Sure. My name is Elwood Espiritu I guess I'm a designer. But yeah, I have a few brands. One is called Slow Jamz. It's inspired by like, 90s 2000s like hip hop and R and B. It's also like a mood board page to where I can, you know, display what type of music I'm listening to and like, Cool imagery that is very nostalgic, and then making like, apparel based on those things. Second brand is color archive. It's like 2000s, like, inspired like era, like sportswear like clothing and stuff. Right now we make like beanies. So that's kind of our bread and butter right now, but we're transitioning into like, you know, more basketball centric, like clothing. And then the third one is Studio Espiritu. That's like a design like studio for making custom rugs. </p>

          <p class="fadein"> And, yeah, back then. I guess during the pandemic, a lot of people have a lot of free time. So then I had a ton of free time. So then, you know, I wanted to take up rug making and it was kind of reserved for like older middle America, like women, you know making rugs like it was arts and crafts, you know, type of activity then once it kind of hit Tik-Tok then it really exploded and like, you know, all types of people like, ages are doing it.
          </p>
          
          <p class="fadein"> So yeah, that's kind of where that's at right now I worked at this startup objects. It's like the sneaker rental service. But yeah, you just rent sneakers, like, you know, really exclusive stuff like Travis Scott's like these these things like, yeah, you could rent a monthly, like, instead of paying like, a couple 100 or 1000 bucks for them, you could just pay a monthly fee, and then switch out your shoes. And yeah, that's currently what I'm doing.
          </p>
        
          
          <p class="fadein"><b>When did you first start Slow Jamz? 
          </b>
          </p>
          
          <p class="fadein">So Slow Jamz came first. That started maybe in like 2016 or 17. So those are It was like I made a shirt. Or the first shirt I made was like an Andre 3000 rap tee, and then that was under like my name. And then I was like, maybe I should be like, you know, putting this under a brand.
          </p>
          
          <p class="fadein">So that's when like the slogan started and then first started off with, some tees, like one design, but in like, a bunch of colors. And then it graduated to like more graphics. And then I started to really honing in on like, the whole mood board. type of like page. So I can consistently have content, because the thing with like, having a brand is like, you need to have a lot of content, if I feel like if I had was only doing apparel, then you would just post like photoshoots or, you know, photos of people wearing the clothes, and then that's kind of hard to keep up. But with the mood board page, I can really like display and like provide value to like people so they can you know, connect with the brand in different ways.

          <p class="fadein"><b>Was the community approach something you had in mind when you started? That's a very different approach, I would say to a lot of other brands. Many just do product shots and then drop day, you know? You're pumping out content almost every day or pretty much every day, you know?</b></p>

          <p class="fadein">Yeah, so like building a community because at the end of the day, like I want everyone to have my clothes and then also like, connect with a lot of people that are also interested in like, like Luther Vandross and D'Angelo. Like, it's, you know, looking for those people that are into it. Like, because there's a lot of like, moodboard pages now it is like, yeah, like Hidden NY, Gardens and Seeds, like, See Reverse For Care, like those types of things. </p>

          <p class="fadein">And it's all kind of the same stuff like Kanye West for like, you know, dunks, Jordans, like old Kobe photos. And just like, you know, Range Rovers and Porsches. Like it's all kind of the same stuff. But for me, I'm trying to separate and like kind of, provide more like nice things, and also giving some like background behind those things. Like, anyone can throw like, a picture of Frank Ocean, like, on their page and call it a day. But like, when you can find out like, where it came from, and like, when was this taken? And like, why is this important? Like, I feel like that's so much more like valuable and something I would be interested in following.  </p>

          <p class="fadein">So yeah, it's a bit easier to do it, like a mood board style, like I first adapted it from like, JJJJOUND. And also like Sporty and Rich. And then now there's like, archive pages, man, mood board pages all over the place, but I feel like those two really pioneered that whole like, type of like approach to like, their brand.
          </p>
          
          <p class="fadein"><b> Do you think because of the way that you've built Slow Jamz to operate, when the pandemic started, did you have any obstacles?. Were you worried about manufacturing? And like getting product out? Or pre orders? Because I know, that's been a really popular thing for people too. </b></p>
          
          <p class="fadein">Yeah, yeah, I would say that, like, in the manufacturing side, and like making products, like, they're the factory that makes all of my shirts, like, they got hit with a bunch of like, COVID blood cases, so they had to close down and people had to find alternatives. It's la apparel, which is like, you know, they're based in like, LA, and, like, the shirts are, like, all made here. And like, so. Like, I'm pretty, like, supportive of like that company, because they pay like all their seamstresses and seams, the people who like make the shirts, like, they're all paid like a living wage, versus like, you know, someone who works in like, the sweatshops, and they only get paid like, you know, $2 per shirt, or like, $2 an hour. </p>
        
          
          <p class="fadein">I mean, so, in terms of like production, I had to find different like, manufacturers, because LA Apparrel kind of slowed down for a bit. And it's not just me, it's a bunch of like, other t shirt brands, like in Los Angeles, like born and raised Chinatown market, like Union, Brain Dead, like, you know, they're all looking for different manufacturers. So that kind of slowed me down. But I would say the benefit of the pandemic is just having a ton of like, free time. So just kind of like refocusing on like, you know, where my brands will go. I don't lean too heavily on like, drops are like making products, because it is kind of like a balance between, you know, making clothes, and then also doing the whole like Instagram page and like, giving content out every day. And that's great. Like, you know, posting on Instagram is free, and like, you know, engaging with my customer. </p>
          
          <p class="fadein">And building like the community. Like, that's all free Instagram. But with clothes, it's just like, a way to express yourself. So like, if I were to buy, like, you know, a Slow Jamz gym shirt, I'm buying it because like, I support, you know, the spirit, I like, what they post on Instagram and identify with like that community. </p>

          <p class="fadein"><b> </b></p>

          <p class="fadein">But another thing you mentioned, too, was like the whole, like, pre order system, I noticed that a lot of brands are like doing that now. One, because like, overhead is kind of like difficult to deal with just having a bunch of extras of like old product. And then number two, like the environmental like, aspect of it, like you don't want to have anything extras or like, you only want to make what's like what's available for, you know, the people that actually want.  </p>

          <p class="fadein"> So you're not making too many. And everyone gets what they want. So I noticed a lot of brands are doing that. And a lot of them are operating on that type of system now. Like Sporty and Rich, they used to be pre orders own and then Hidden New York, they're doing pre orders as well, too. Like I just bought a few things from the drop yesterday. Yeah. And it was like four to six weeks, like production. And then I was like, Man, that sucks. But at the same time, we'll forget about it. And then it'll come in the mail. And we're like, sick, like, I'm home anyway. So it's fine.

      </div>

         <div class="row justify-content-center mt-5">
          <div class="col-12 col-sm-8 col-md-6"> 

          <p class="fadein"><b>So do you think moving forward, since a lot of brands have switched to that pre order system, that that's something that will become more standard, even after the pandemic sort of subsides away? Or do you think most people will probably go back to doing in hand drops, or, certain items are pre orders if they're limited? </b></p>
          
          <p class="fadein">I think that's my number one issue when it comes to like making products and stuff, because my end goal is, so everyone can have the stuff that I make, like, like, if everyone has a shirt that you make, that's kind of the goal, versus like having a very exclusive product that everyone keeps having to like, restock, like, I'm trying to figure out the the number and like balance between the two, having like a pre order system and like an enhanced drop. Because it's a constant cycle of like, let's say I do pre orders for like this, this new drop that I just did. So there it was all pre orders. And then I make just a little bit extra to sell for the next people who wants to buy it, if they missed out on the pre orders, right. So then everyone will get the pre order stuff sent to them after like, a few weeks. And then you know, there's a little bit extra on stock on the website. </p>
          
          
          <p class="fadein">So then after that, like it's a new wave of people seeing the shirts that their friends got or the blanket. And then they're like, dang, now I want one and then it's kind of like a cycle that. So then I like have no product at the end of the day like because you know it's through the cycle, then I would have to restock again. And that itself is a whole process because like I get the neck label sewn and I get it like folded and like, you know, prepped and everything. So it's kind of like a longer process now. So is it more so just like should I make a bunch of products, like a ton of quantities, or just kind of keep going through this like restock pre order system? And yeah, that's kind of like the difficult part about it. </p>

          <p class="fadein"> A lot of brands like they do want to make things exclusive for people. But, like, at the end of the day, I don't really see anyone else wearing like the Frank Ocean shirts in my city. Like right. So you know, things aren't really aren't that exclusive. But, you know, people want to feel like it's exclusive. And to have something that no one else has. </p>

          <p class="fadein"><b> </b></p>

          <p class="fadein">But yeah, that's kind of like the issue and I think like more people will adopt the preorder system because they can see how beneficial it is to their business. Like you're selling for sure, like orders and stuff. But as long as you can promise on like the quality and like the quantity and like the turnaround time, then I think that's what really matters because You don't want to save, you know, four weeks, but it takes you like two months.
          </p>

          <p class="fadein"><b>So just guarantee as long as you can guarantee that the timeframe you're giving to people?
          </b></p>
            
          <p class="fadein">Yeah, yeah. And then if you're, like honest with everyone, and like, you know, give them updates on, like, production time. You know, that's pretty important is like, forget and like, you know, it said, like, three to four weeks production time, something like that. And most of us will forget it, other people are like, you know, checking their emails every day hoping for tracking and, you know, I'm a victim of that, too. I was waiting for shoes to come in for the past few days. And like, I was checking the tracking and like, yeah, it's kind of just like, managing expectations for like the customer and making sure like, you know, you do what you say. </p>

          <p class="fadein">Well, I'm working my job right now. And it's like, nine to five. And, like, it's, it's pretty hard. Because I was used to having part time jobs and, you know, like, being like, unemployed to like, and that was fun, because you're getting paid, like, you know, a little bit, just to, like, you know, stay at home.

And then, you know, we'll have drinks there, you pay like 40-50 bucks to get in. And then all the paint supplies are like, provided, we'll have like an artist teaching how to paint. And then like, I DJ while all of this is happening. And, you know, that's like a fun time, like, a fun night out, like with your friends and like, that could be like a monthly thing.

          But, you know, throughout the year, like I've gained a lot of like, resources and made a lot of friends to where like, this can actually be a thing once like, you know, things open up in, like, June, July or so. So, I would say focusing on more like community stuff. I guess, kind of having more of a physical presence. So like, you know, having being sold at like, retailers worldwide, that'd be nice. I guess products wise, like, I want to do more fun things. Like I feel like accessories is really where, like, a brand shows its personality. Like, he can make clothes you can make, like, you know, shirts and hoodies and socks, but then making like the fun things like rugs like that'll really showcase like a brand's personality or, like, you know how supreme does like a ton of like, really random things like pinball machines, like, you know, jet skis.

          <p class="fadein"><b> So basically like lifestyle items?</b></p>
            
          <p class="fadein">
          Yeah. Like I would want to be a part of someone else's like lifestyle thing if, if it makes sense. So like, maybe doing something with like, more music. Focus, like yeah, I don't really know. But like, I'm doing candles. So that's kind of my first like, foray into I guess achieving like different senses, like you know, because slow jams is like an auditory thing. Listen to music. So that's why I made the mixes and then, like, now candles will be the smell portion of it. And then, you know, just trying to find different ways to make my brand exciting.

And then like, you know, they have really bad product shots, or like, there's something wrong with like, their graphic, or like, their shirt. Like, there's small things that you'll learn as you go. Like, you don't really learn too much of this stuff by like, you know, like researching, or, like, you know, word of mouth, like, asking friends and stuff. Like, I feel like you learn a lot of stuff by actually doing it. And kind of just striving to go to like, mess up, because then you'll realize, like, Oh, this is how it's supposed to be like, so kind of just aiming for failure, I guess.</p>

So then, once I actually started making, like, the first rugs, that's when I learned how to do it.

I mean, your taste level doesn't match your skill level, because, like, I have a high standard of what I want to do, but I can't design to that standard. Because like, you know, we follow like a bunch of these like, brands and, like people. And you know, we strive to be like them. And, you know, we we aspire to like, you know, have our tastes level like that or design something cool like that. But when we actually try to go for it, it just doesn't reach, you know, what we're looking for, you know, so I guess understanding that really kind of helped me out and realize, like, you know, it's, it's not just me, it's just like, the way things are. And like, I feel like once you reach that, that level then I guess that's like mastery.
